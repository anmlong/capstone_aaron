## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
gl %>%
  print(n = 5)
gl1 <- gl %>%
  filter(glaucoma == "1")
gl1 %>%
  print(n=5)
#I made a new data set of the glaucoma samples
```
```{r}
gl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = ocular_pressure, )) +
  geom_point()
#looking for trends with age. With all the samples, the trend is for a higher ocular pressure with age.
gl1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = ocular_pressure, )) +
  geom_point()
#For glaucoma sample, the trend is for a higher ocular pressure with age
gl0 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = ocular_pressure, )) +
  geom_point()
#for healthy samples there is no obvious trend
```
```{r}
gl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = MD, )) +
  geom_point()
#looking for trends with MD. With all the samples, the trend is for a lower MD with age.
gl1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = MD, )) +
  geom_point()
#For glaucoma sample, the trend is for a lower MD with age
gl0 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = MD, )) +
  geom_point()
#for healthy samples there is no change in MD with age
```
```{r}
gl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = PSD, )) +
  geom_point()
#looking for trends with PSD. With all the samples, the trend is for a higher PSD with age.
gl1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = PSD, )) +
  geom_point()
#For glaucoma sample, the there is no obvious trend with PSD and age
gl0 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = PSD, )) +

```
```{r}

  geom_point()
#looking for trends with GHT. With all the samples, There is no clear pattern with age. Mosty 0 or 2.
gl1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = GHT, )) +
  geom_point()
#For glaucoma sample, the there is no obvious trend with GHT and age. More 2's overall.
gl0 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = GHT, )) +
  geom_point()
#for healthy samples there is no obvious trend with GHT and age. More 0's overall.
```
```{r}

```

```{r}

  geom_point()
#looking for trends with RNFL4.mean. With all the samples, There is no clear pattern with age.

  geom_point()
#For glaucoma sample, the there is no obvious trend with RNFL4.mean and age.
gl0 %>%

  geom_point()
#for healthy samples there is no obvious trend with RNFL4.mean and age.
```
```{r}
#I looked at changes in the data with age. Trends that change with age.
#overall: ocular_pressure (higher), MD (lower), PSD (higher), GHT (none), cornea_thickness (none), RNFL4.mean (none)
#glaucoma samples: ocular_pressure (higher), MD  (lower), PSD (none), GHT (none), cornea_thickness (none), RNFL4.mean (none)
#healthy samples: ocular_pressure (none), MD (none), PSD (none), GHT (none), cornea_thickness (none), RNFL4.mean (none)
